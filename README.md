Insta-X Downloader

A simple yet powerful web application built with Flask that allows you to download videos and images from Instagram and X (formerly Twitter) posts directly from your browser.
‚ú® Key Features

    Dual Platform Support: Seamlessly download media from both Instagram and X (Twitter).

    User-Friendly Web UI: A clean, minimalistic interface for pasting URLs and managing downloads.

    Asynchronous Operations: Downloads are handled in background threads, ensuring the UI remains responsive and non-blocking.

    Real-Time Progress Tracking: The frontend polls the server to provide live status updates for each download job (e.g., pending, downloading, completed, failed).

    Instant Media Previews: Once a download is complete, you can preview images and videos directly on the page.

    Direct Download Links: Get direct links to download the saved media files.

    Vercel Ready: Comes pre-configured with a vercel.json file for effortless, one-command deployment.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The application's logic is straightforward:

    URL Submission: A user pastes a valid Instagram or X/Twitter post URL into the input field on the homepage.

    Backend Job Creation: The frontend sends an asynchronous request to the /download endpoint. The Flask backend receives the URL, creates a unique job_id for the request, and spins up a new background thread to handle the download. This immediately frees up the main thread and returns the job_id to the user.

    Media Scraping:

        For Instagram URLs, the powerful instaloader library is used to log in (if required for private accounts) and fetch the media.

        For X/Twitter URLs, the versatile yt-dlp library is used to extract and download the video or images.

    Status Polling: The frontend uses the received job_id to periodically make requests to the /job/<job_id> endpoint to check the current status of the download.

    Displaying Results: Once the job status changes to completed, the frontend receives the paths to the downloaded files. It then dynamically renders these files as previews (using <img> or <video> tags) along with direct download links.

üöÄ Getting Started Locally

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.
Prerequisites

    Python 3.9 or newer

    pip (Python package installer)

Installation

    Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/insta-x-flask-downloader.git
    cd insta-x-flask-downloader

    Create and activate a virtual environment:

    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # For Windows
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate

    Install the required dependencies:
    The project's dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file.

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    Run the Flask application:

    flask run

    The application will now be running and accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This project is configured for easy deployment on Vercel.

The vercel.json file in the root directory tells Vercel how to build and serve the Flask application.

{
    "version": 2,
    "builds": [
      { 
        "src": "app.py", 
        "use": "@vercel/python" 
      }
    ],
    "routes": [
      { 
        "src": "/(.*)", 
        "dest": "app.py" 
      }
    ]
}

To deploy your application, install the Vercel CLI and run the vercel command from the project's root directory.

npm install -g vercel
vercel

Follow the on-screen prompts, and your application will be live in minutes!
